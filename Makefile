# Shared kernel config fragments live in shared/*.config. Each target subdir

# target via a git `sparse:` dep and artifact checksums cover every build
# input. `make sync` materializes the shared fragment(s) into each target;
# edit shared/, run `make sync`, commit.

# Controller firmware is NOT vendored here — each system enables
# BR2_PACKAGE_RPI_DISTRO_BLUEZ_FIRMWARE, which installs the Pi BT .hcd set
# (and the board-specific symlinks btbcm wants) at build time.

# All BT-capable target forks. (rpi, rpi2 have no onboard Bluetooth.)
